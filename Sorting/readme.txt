File name normalizer capitalizes to first letter of file names and makes the rest (including extension) lowercase. File name normalizer also replaces underscores with spaces.

Sequential renamer renames files in sequence. For example, 3 files could automatically be renamed to "File1.txt, File2.txt, File3.txt". Sequential renamer also makes file extensions all lowercase.
